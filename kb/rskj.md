**RSKj** is the software used to run nodes on the RSK network.

You can run
[RSKj](/rsk/node/) locally to connect to the public RSK networks -
[RSK Mainnet](https://explorer.rsk.co/), and the
[RSK Testnet](https://explorer.testnet.rsk.co/).
This is an alternative to connecting to the
[public nodes](/rsk/public-nodes/).

RSKj can also run in a “localhost”-only environment, without connecting to any public network - [RSK Regtest](/rsk/node/configure/switch-network/#regtest)

If you do one of the following activities, you are likely to need to run RSKj on your computer.

- Development <!-- → /kb/rskj-for-developers TODO add link -->
- Running nodes <!-- → /kb/rskj-for-node-runners  TODO add link -->
- Mining <!-- → /kb/rskj-for-miners TODO add link -->

If none of the above applies to you, it is quite likely that you do not need to run RSKj software on your computer.

- If you would like to interact with a DApp
  - Use [Web3 enabled wallet software](https://developers.rsk.co/wallet/use) 
  <!-- (URL) → /kb/dapps-web3 -->
  - [Configure MetaMask to connect to RSK](https://developers.rsk.co/tutorials/ethereum-devs/remix-and-metamask-with-rsk-testnet/)
    is a step by step guide demonstrating how to interact with a DApp on RSK using MetaMask.
- If you would like to build a DApp on RSK
    - Check out the [Complete Full Stack dApp Guide on RSK](https://developers.rsk.co/guides/full-stack-dapp-on-rsk/part1-overview/)
- If you would like to check the status of the RSK network, use;
  - [RSK Mainnet Stats](https://stats.rsk.co/)
  - [RSK Testnet Stats](https://stats.testnet.rsk.co/)
- If you would like to check the status of a particular transaction, use;
  - [RSK Explorer](https://explorer.rsk.co/)

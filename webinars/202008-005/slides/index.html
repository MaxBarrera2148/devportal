NOTE:

`Dulce`

- We both work in IOV Labs, the umbrella organization for RSK, Taringa, and RIF.
- RSK is the smart contract platform secured by the bitcoin mining hash power,
  and therefore the most secure one.
- Taringa is a social media platform, and
- RIF offers a suite of services for the decentralised Internet:
  name service, payments, communications, storage, and  marketplaces... all decentralised.
- IOV is building a fully decentralized internet for Financial Inclusion.

## Pre-requisites

[developers.rsk.co/tutorials/workshop-prereqs](/tutorials/workshop-prereqs/)

[POSIX compliant shell](/tutorials/workshop-prereqs/#posix-compliant-shell) /
[curl](/tutorials/workshop-prereqs/#curl) /
[NodeJs](/tutorials/workshop-prereqs/#nodejs) /
[Code editor](/tutorials/workshop-prereqs/#code-editor) /
[OpenZeppelin CLI](/tutorials/workshop-prereqs/#openzeppelin-cli) /
[Java](/tutorials/workshop-prereqs/#java) /
[RSKj](/tutorials/workshop-prereqs/#rskj)

NOTE:

- Please make sure you have all of these things installed and working on your system
- For those of you who have attended the
  smart contract testing with truffle webinar last month,
  you should be almost ready to go, just need to install the OZ CLI,
  which is a single `npm i` command

---

## Testing JS

- **None** of these:
  - Smart contracts, Solidity, DApps
- **Instead**:
  - Only Javascript

NOTE:

`Brendan`

The title of this webinar is testing smart contracts with OZ CLI.
But we will not start with any of those things at all.
Instead we'll focus solely on Javascript.
After we have done out first hands on,
you will see why!

---

## Testing JS: Objectives

- What is testing?
- Software engineering principles - Why test?
- Writing tests in JS using Mocha

NOTE:

`Brendan`

We have a few learning objectives here today.
We'll start with what testing is, and why we need to do it.
Subsequently, we will write tests in Mocha using Javascript.

---

## Mocha

- A test runner for JS
- Can execute "spec" files either in browser, or in NodeJs
- Executes tests, outputs reports

NOTE:

`Dulce`

- Mocha is a test runner (or test framework) for Javascript that can run either in the browser or in NodeJs
- Today, we'll only be using NodeJs
- The main task of a test runner is to execute tests and generate a report
- But before we get there, we first need to understand some terms: Implementation, specification, and then, we can loop back to the test runner

---

### Implementation

- Code that you write
- Executes when the program is being used
- You are *implementing* the *features* of your software
- `impl`

NOTE:

`Dulce`

- Implementations form the actual parts of the code that perform the functionality of your program or application

---

### Specification

- **Also** code that you write
- Does **not** execute when the program is being used
- Instead it executes the implementation
- You are *specifying* the *features* of your software
- `spec`

NOTE:

`Dulce`

- Specifications are similar to implementation because they are also code
- However they are not executed by the user of your program or application, instead the specifications run the implementations in certain pre-defined ways.

---

### Test runner

- A developer **tool**
- **runner** `‚ïêexec‚üπ` **specification** `‚ïêexec‚üπ` **implementation**
- **runner** `‚ïêobserves‚üπ` **behaviour** `‚ïêproduces‚üπ` **report**
- Mocha

NOTE:

`Brendan`

- a test runner is sometimes also referred to as a test framework
- mocha is the test runner which we will be using today
- what it does its it executes your specs, which in turn execute your impls,
- at the same time, in the background,
  the test runner also is doing something else:
  it is observing the execution,
  recording which specs pass and which ones fail,
- ... and finally it outputs a report at the end.

---

### More theory

- [Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing)/
  [Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing)/
  [Acceptance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_testing)
- [Black box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-box_testing)/
  [White box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-box_testing)
- [Code coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage)

NOTE:

`Brendan`

- there is a lot more to testing than what we have just covered
- so that we don't go over time, here we simply have links to a lot of material on wikipedia,
  which define various testing related terminology
  which you're encouraged to read after this webinar
- for now, we have covered the basics required to do our hands on with pure javascript,
  and then move on to testing solidity

---

### Pre-requisites

[developers.rsk.co/tutorials/workshop-prereqs/](/tutorials/workshop-prereqs/)

[POSIX compliant shell](/tutorials/workshop-prereqs/#posix-compliant-shell) /
[NodeJs](/tutorials/workshop-prereqs/#nodejs)

NOTE:

- To follow along in this hands-on section of the workshop,
  you will need to have these things on your system
- For those of you who have just joined us,
  please check out the pre-requisites section that we covered at the beginning of the webinar,
  this is merely a quick recap

---

## Testing JS: Hands-on

[developers.rsk.co/tutorials/workshop-js-testing](https://developers.rsk.co/tutorials/workshop-js-testing/)

NOTE:

`Brendan`

Let's begin

---

## Testing JS: Hands-on

[developers.rsk.co/tutorials/workshop-js-testing/](/tutorials/workshop-js-testing/)

NOTE:

`Brendan`

- Alright, now we're going to do a Javascript testing hands-on.
- Please follow the link above and it will take you to the workshop materials
- This was originally created for a DApps Dev Club
  session that I ran last year.
- This is a version of that that had been trimmed down significantly,
  to just focus on the most important parts,
  so as to be able to run through the lot within the webinar time

---

## Right/wrong impl/spec

![DApps Dev Club - Implementation Specification Correctness Quadrants](/webinars/202007-005/dapps-dev-club-implementation-specification-correctness-quadrants.png) <!-- .element: style="max-width: 50%; max-height: 50%;" -->

NOTE:

`Brendan`

- Now that we have executed `npm run test`,
  we have completed writing a correct implementation,
  and a correct specification
- That's the best combination to have, but you cannot know that for sure
- The remainder of this hands-on exercise will take you through
  various combinations of right and wrong impls,
  and right and wrong specs,
  which result in false positives, et cetera
- However, we won't be doing this in today's session in light of time -
  you are of course encouraged to do this in your own time!

---

## Testing Solidity

|  | Impl | Spec | Test Runner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Javascript | `*.js` | `*.spec.js` | `mocha` |
| Smart contract | `*.sol` | `*.spec.js` | `truffle test` |
| Smart contract | `*.sol` | `*.spec.js` | `mocha` + `oz` |

NOTE:

`Brendan`

- As promised earlier, we're going to switch gears from testing pure Javascript to testing smart contracts
- In the previous webinar on testing, we switched from using mocha as the test runner,
  to using Truffle as the test runner
- In that webinar, many of you wondered why we spent all that time earlier learning about mocha.
- That was because Truffle test is based on Mocha - it is just a wrapper around it.
- Now OZ CLI does not do the same thing as Truffle on this front,
  and we runs our tests using mocha as the test runner directly.
- So we **will** continue to use it directly,
  but we will link in some open zeppelin testing libraries within the tests.

---

### `mocha` vs `truffle test`

| `mocha` | `truffle test` |
| --- | --- |
| `require()` | `artifacts.require()` |
| `describe()` | `contract()` |
| `describe(() => {...})` | `contract((accounts) => {...})` |


NOTE:

`Brendan`

- When using Truffle, we needed to be aware of the differences between mocha and truffle test,
  and the most commonly encountered ones are summarised in this table.
- However, in OZ CLI we're using mocha directly, so there is no need for this at all.

---

### `mocha` vs `truffle test` vs `mocha` w/ OZ CLI

| `truffle test` | `mocha` w/ OZ CLI |
| --- | --- |
| `artifacts.require()` | `contract.fromArtifact()` |
| `contract()` | `describe()` |
| `contract((accounts) => {...})` | `require('@openzeppelin/test-environment').accounts` |


NOTE:

`Brendan`

- Now we see all 3 variations
- We will look at these in more detail during the hands-on exercise later

---

### State machines

- Finite State Automata

NOTE:

`Brendan`

- Before we start the hands-on section,
  let's talk about some computer science,
  very briefly, so that we have a better
  understanding of our approach towards testing.
- "State machines" is a term that derives from Mathematics about finite state automata
- Smart contracts have properties of state machines, let's get into some specifics

----

### State

- Smart contracts are stateful systems.
- This means that a smart contract can be
  said to be in a particular "state",
  at any point of time.
- This "state" is a set of variables,
  including their current values,
  stored by the smart contract.

NOTE:

`Brendan`

----

### State transitions

- A state transition is a function that allows
  users to change the state of the smart contract.
- When the values of one or more variables
  in the smart contract is updated,
  that is a state change.
- A transaction added to to the ledger is the
  vehicle for a smart contract state change.

NOTE:

`Brendan`

---

## Testing Solidity: Hands-on

- State
- State transitions
- Events
- ~~Mocked functions~~

NOTE:

`Brendan`

- Here are a few common categories of things to do while testing
- We will **not** be doing any mocking in this session in light of time constraints. Instead, we'll give ourselves more time to focus on testing state, state transitions, and events

---

### Pre-requisites:

[developers.rsk.co/tutorials/workshop-prereqs](/tutorials/workshop-prereqs/)

[POSIX compliant shell](/tutorials/workshop-prereqs/#posix-compliant-shell) /
[NodeJs](/tutorials/workshop-prereqs/#nodejs) /
[OpenZeppelin CLI](/tutorials/workshop-prereqs/#openzeppelin-cli) /
[RSKj](/tutorials/workshop-prereqs/#rskj)

NOTE:

- To follow along in this hands-on section of the workshop, you will need to have these things on your system
- For those of you who have just joined us,
  please check out the prerequisites section that we covered
  at the beginning of the webinar,
  this is merely a quick recap

---

## Testing Solidity: Hands-on

[developers.rsk.co/tutorials/workshop-smart-contract-testing-truffle](/tutorials/workshop-smart-contract-testing-truffle/)

NOTE:

`Brendan`

- In this hands-on session, we are going to make use of a demo truffle project which has all of the stuff mostly in place, and you just to `git clone` the starting point
- You will also need to install OZ CLI via NodeJs
- And finally you will need to have the RSK node, called RSKj, installed on your system and running on the Regtest network
  - If you do not have this on your system already, please check out our previous webinars in which we go through the steps for this in great detail
- Please go ahead and open up the link to that article which contains a step by step walk through of this workshops
- You will need to clone the github link for the project in that repo

---

## Summary

- Testing
- Smart contracts as state machines
- Differences between Truffle and OZ CLI
- Testing Javascript: **impl** and **spec** were both JS
- Testing Solidity: **impl** was Solidity, **spec** was JS

NOTE:

`Dulce`

- While this webinar has been primarily intended as a hands-on workshop, we have covered some theory too, to do with software engineering principles around testing, and thinking about smart contracts in terms of state and state transitions.
- And in the hands on section we created a Javascript application and tested it with Javascript, and followed that up with creating a smart contract in Solidity and testing that with Javascript.
- However, note that you always have the option of running tests against your smart contracts deployed on a real peer-to-peer decentralised blockchain network, such as the RSK Testnet, or even the RSK Mainnet - but usually one would reserve this for a later stage in the project where you have considerations such as economic incentive based attacks or networks congestions or gas price hikes.
  - The sample code in this repo includes ready-to-go config for connecting to
    RSK Regtest, RSK Testnet, ands RSK Mainnet

Once that is complete you can define multiple **Billing Plans**, each of them containing a **price, a payment token, and a billing period (daily, weekly, or monthly)**. You can define different combinations and offer different Billing Plans for your storage offer, as shown below.

![UserGuide - Marketplace Storage Sell Form](/rif/marketplace/guide/images/userguide-marketplace-storage-sell-form.png)

![UserGuide - Confirm Transaction](/rif/marketplace/guide/images/userguide-marketplace-storage-sell-confirm2.png)

5- Offers can be managed through the **MY OFFERS** section where you can access a list of existing agreements and withdraw the earned funds.

![UserGuide - Marketplace Storage Withdraw](/rif/marketplace/guide/images/userguide-marketplace-storage-sell-withdraw.png)

Once you click on **WITHDRAW** this will submit a transaction that needs to be confirmed in the Wallet and processed in order to get the earned funds.

**Note:** It is important to remark that during this Beta phase, Storage Providers need to be *whitelisted* in the smart contract so please contact us if you are interested!

### Setup Pinning Service

1 - Go to the Marketplace Storage Sell page and start the creation process: [RIF Marketplace Sell Page](https://marketplace.rifos.org/storage/sell). You will see that your RSK address is not registered as a Storage provider yet.

![RIF Marketplace Register Page](/rif/marketplace/guide/images/userguide-marketplace-storage-sell-register.png)

2 - That means you need to get whitelisted. Please submit the whitelisting request here: [Whitlisting Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1J20qP8iid6j-7kJ_GMZ7MfMOtwrFspH25P5WErVZP-U/edit?gxids=7628). While your request is being processed, you need to install the Storage Pinner application and generate a Peer ID. On the same page, click the ‘Get Peer ID’ link and follow the instructions.

![RIF Marketplace Register Small](/rif/marketplace/guide/images/userguide-marketplace-storage-register-small.png)

![RIF Marketplace Installation Instructions](/rif/marketplace/guide/images/userguide-marketplace-storage-reg-instructions.png)

3 - During the package installation, run the `init` command. The pinner DB is instantiated for the given Offer ID and a new Peer ID is generated. You should have a result similar to this one:

```
rif-pinning init --offerId 0x8dc5758fff238ce129121031969dffd4a58a4e5f

Init DB... done
Set Offer ID... done
Generating Peer Identity... done
Your PeerId: QmYekG8Nkm1co9VxSLqCBnm9mxPYtabL1Q7emzU322KKdm
```
 
(Note: make sure your address/Offer ID is lower case)

4 - The URL may be displayed depending on the config which points to Marketplace and has the Peer ID as a parameter. Otherwise, navigate to the URL where you started: [RIF Marketplace Sell Page](https://marketplace.rifos.org/storage/sell) and copy-paste the Peer ID generated in the previous step.

5 - After [Creating an Offer](#offer-storage) you are ready to start the rif-pinning daemon and an IPFS node. To run an IPFS node, please refer to the [IPFS documentation](https://docs.ipfs.io/how-to/command-line-quick-start/).
To run the RIF Pinner with default configurations, execute the following in the terminal:

```
rif-pinning daemon --network mainnet
or
rif-pinning daemon --network testnet
```

This command starts listening for new Agreements, and connects to IPFS. By default, it expects the IPFS node to run on port 5001. If you want to customize rif-pinner daemon behaviour, execute:

```
rif-pinning daemon help
```

To perform any other tasks with the rif-pinner:
```
rif-pinning help

To use the application and the service we are going to need three things:

1. An internet browser extension wallet. Read [Compatible wallets](#compatible-wallets) how to get a compatible wallet, or read the guides to connect [Nifty wallet](#connect-nifty-wallet-to-rsk) and [Metamask wallet](#connect-metamask-wallet-to-rsk) to RSK
2. RBTC to pay for the transaction cost. See [Getting RBTC](#getting-rbtc)
3. RIF tokens to buy and sell RNS domains. See [Getting RIF Tokens](#getting-rif-tokens). Also, read [display amount of tokens](#display-amount-of-tokens-in-the-nifty-wallet) on how to view your tokens in your wallet.

### Compatible wallets

The RIF Marketplace can be used seamlessly with the following wallets. To setup your wallet, follow the instructions in [connect to RSK network](#connect-nifty-wallet-to-rsk).

### Getting RBTC

Since the RIF Marketplace works on top of RSK blockchain, to pay for transactional fees you will need RBTC tokens. This is going to be used to pay for any transaction performed in the RIF Marketplace.

Read the [R-BTC Token](https://developers.rsk.co/rsk/rbtc/) to find exchanges and more RBTC token information.


> If you are using the testnet you can get free funds in the [RSK faucet](https://faucet.rsk.co/)

### Getting RIF Tokens

The RNS domains in the RIF Marketplace have a value in RIF tokens.

Read [RIF Token](https://developers.rsk.co/rif/token/) to find exchanges and more information on the RIF Token.

> If you are using the testnet you can get free funds in the [RIF faucet](https://faucet.rifos.org/)

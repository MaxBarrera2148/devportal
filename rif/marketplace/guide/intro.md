The main goal of the RIF Marketplace is to enable a fast and efficient creation of decentralized sharing economies (DSE) on top of RSK and RIF, providing the required tools to bring together service providers and consumers.  Providers can list their offerings and connect with potential users for a wide range of decentralized services such as Storage, Payments,  Communications, and Data Services, presenting at the same time a common and unified interface and user experience.

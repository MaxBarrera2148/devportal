The endpoint [`http://localhost:8080/getSubscriptionPlans`](http://localhost:8080/getSubscriptionPlans) can be used to get a list of subscription plans along with the accepted currencies and the price in each currency. Optionally `activePlans=true` parameter can be sent to retrieve only the active subscription plans.

###### Getting notifications

```shell
GET Request: http://localhost:8080/getNotifications
Header params:
	    key: apiKey
	    value: API_KEY
Query params:
	idTopic [Optional]: The notifications will be filtered with this param, so it brings only the idTopics associated with each, you can send lots of ids, separating each with commas: 12,15,21
	fromId [Optional]: Each notification has an id, you can make a greater than by providing this param
	lastRows [Optional]: With this param you can set how many notifications the notifier returns. MAX is set in `applications.properties` at 1000, so this number needs to be less than that.

### What is the difference between Chainbeat and Block Explorers?

Chainbeat empowers everyone to do more with actionable and functional data. Block Explorers provide transactional level information without any context. Chainbeat will bridge this gap by providing high-level contextual information that directly translates how, why, and when decentralized apps and protocols get used.
